  <h2>Content Visuals</h2>

  <p>
    Non-decorative Visuals (i.e. Content Visuals) that have an essential second
    dimension to be valuable, can have an additional scroll bar specific to its
    container.

  <h3>Keyboard Users who zoom</h3>

  <p>
    Keyboard users need access to the scroll bar the content visuals generate on
    zoom such that. . .
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>they can scroll using the keyboard</li>
    <li>
      they do not get lost as they move from the scrolling content to non
      scrolling content.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Users who are blind</h3>

  <p>
    A screen reader user would be informed that a Content Visual exists in the
    layout along with its associated alt-text.
  </p>

  <p>
    However it is unclear, how adding a <code>tabindex</code> for the Content
    Visual (because of the keyboard user who zooms) 'works' for a screen reader
    users.
